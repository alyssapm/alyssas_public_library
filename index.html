    <p> hi! my name is alyssa, and when i'm at home, i usually find myself
        very overwhelmed by the amount of books that i have since i don't
        exactly have a physical organization system. since i'm also a cs major
        i decided it would be fun to sort them digitally!
        <br> i'm going to organize my books in three categories, in addition
             to alphabetically:
        <ul>
          <li> genre </li>
          <li> rating </li>
          <li> length </li>
        </ul>
        i'm also going to have a form for people to submit recommendations as
        i want to grow my library, but i don't really know how to. anyway thank
        you for visiting :P
      </p>
